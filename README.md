In this process, we leverage Databricks to run PySpark and SparkSQL, taking advantage of Databricks' scalable cluster environment. Databricks is particularly suitable here as it offers a powerful distributed computing platform that seamlessly integrates with Apache Spark, enabling efficient handling and processing of large datasets. By using Databricks, we can perform complex transformations, aggregations, and queries on big data without the need to manage infrastructure or cluster configuration manually.

The goal of this process is to efficiently explore, analyze, and extract insights from large volumes of crime data from Nova Scotia, Canada, enabling us to identify trends and patterns that may not be visible in smaller samples or limited computing environments. Databricks' scalability and performance make it an ideal choice for handling this level of data processing.
